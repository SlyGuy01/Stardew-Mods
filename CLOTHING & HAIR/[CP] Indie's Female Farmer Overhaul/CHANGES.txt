Changes to This Update:

- Named hats with matching descriptions.
- Aligned several hats for a better fit.
- Removed redundant hat and replaced it with "Magic Rancher Hat". "Magic Wreath" is nearly the same as the removed hat.
- Moved vanilla asset "Butterfly Bow" back to its original location on the sprite sheet. It was once under "Hunter's Cap" (refer also to "Pink Band" for moved asset).
- Simplified and added code.
